ipvsadm - Version 1.11 - 16th June 2000

This is free software.  See below for details.

ippfvsadm is a utility to administer the IP virtual server services
offered by the Linux kernel with virtual server patch.

This version of ipvsadm requires Linux kernel version 2.2.14 plus IPVS
patch 0.9.10 or later.  Check out the Linux Virtual Server Project
home page on the  World Wide Web:
	http://www.LinuxVirtualServer.org/
	or
	http://www.Linux-VS.org/
for the most recent information and original sources about ipvsadm.

To make, make sure your Linux kernel is already patched with IPVS and 
"make menuconfig" or "make xconfig" to setup the right compiling options, 
see the README of the virtual server patch for detail, then simply type
	make
in the source directory.

Install to your liking.  We suggest the following pathnames:
	/sbin/ipvsadm
	/usr/man/man8/ipvsadm.8
This will be done automatically when calling
	make install
in the source directory.
