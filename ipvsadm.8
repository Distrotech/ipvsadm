.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIpvsadm\fR(8) is used to set up, maintain or inspect the virtual
server table in the Linux kernel. The Linux Virtual Server can be used
to build scalable network services based on a cluster of two or more
nodes. The active node of the cluster redirects service requests to a
collection of server hosts that will actually perform the
services. Supported features include two protocols (TCP and UDP),
three packet-forwarding methods (NAT, tunnelling, and direct routing),
and four load balancing algorithms (round robin, weighted round robin,
least-connection and weighted least-connection).
.PP
The command has two basic formats for execution:
.TP
.B ipvsadm \fICOMMAND\fP [\fIprotocol\fP] \fIservice-address\fP 
.ti 15
.B [\fIscheduling-method\fP] [\fIpersistence options\fP]
.TP
.B ipvsadm \fIcommand\fP [\fIprotocol\fP] \fIservice-address\fP 
.ti 15
.B \fIserver-address\fP [\fIpacket-forwarding-method\fP] 
.ti 15
.B [\fIweight options\fP]  
.PP
The first format manipulates a virtual service and the algorithm for
assigning service requests to real servers. Optionally, a
persistent timeout and netmask mask for the granularity of a persistent
service may be specified. The second format manipulates a real server
that is associated with an existing virtual service. When specifying
a real server, the packet-forwarding method and the weight of the real
server, relative to other real servers for the virtual service, may be
specified, otherwise defaults will be used.
.SS COMMANDS
\fBipvsadm\fR(8) recognises the commands described below. Upper-case
commands maintain virtual services. Lower-case commands maintain real
servers that are associated with a virtual service.
.TP
\fB-A, --add-service\fR
Add a virtual service. A service address is uniquely defined by a
triplet: IP address, port number, and protocol. Alternatively, a
virtual service may be defined by a firewall-mark.
.TP
\fB-E, --edit-service\fR
Edit a virtual service.
.TP
\fB-D, --delete-service\fR
Delete a virtual service, along with any associated real servers.
.TP
\fB-C, --clear\fR
Clear the virtual server table.
.TP
\fB-R, --restore\fR
Restore Linux Virtual Server rules from stdin. Each line read from stdin
will be treated as the command line options to a separate invocation of
\fIipvsadm\fP. Lines read from stdin can optionally begin with "ipvsadm".
This option is useful to avoid executing a large number or \fIipvsadm\fP 
commands when constructing an extensive routing table.
.sp
This option only works if \fIipvsadm\fP is compiled against \fBpopt\fR(3).  
.TP
\fB-S, --save\fR
Dump the Linux Virtual Server rules to stdout in a format that can be read
by -R|--restore.
.sp
This option only works if \fIipvsadm\fP is compiled against \fBpopt\fR(3).  
.TP
\fB-a, --add-server\fR
Add a real server to a virtual service.
.TP
\fB-e, --edit-server\fR
Edit a real server in a virtual service.
.TP
\fB-d, --delete-server\fR
Remove a real server from a virtual service.
.TP
\fB-L, -l, --list\fR
Display the virtual server table.
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Display a description of the command syntax.
.SS PARAMETERS
The commands above accept or require zero or more of the following
parameters. 
.TP
.B -t, --tcp-service \fIservice-address\fP
Use TCP service. The \fIservice-address\fP is of the form
\fIhost[:port]\fP.  \fIHost\fP may be either an IP address or a
hostname. \fIPort\fP may be either a port number or the service name
of port. The \fIPort\fP may be omitted, in which case zero will be
used. A \fIPort\fP  of zero is only valid if the service is persistent
as per the -p|--persistent option, in which case it is a wild-card
port, that is connections will be accepted to any port.
.TP
.B -u, --udp-service \fIservice-address\fP
Use UDP service. See the -t|--tcp-service for the description of 
the \fIservice-address\fP.
.TP
.B -f, --fwmark-service \fIinteger\fP
Use a firewall-mark, an integer value greater than zero, to denote a
virtual service instead of an address, port and protocol (UDP or
TCP). The marking of packets with a firewall-mark is configured using
the -m|--mark option to \fBipchains\fR(8). It can be used to build a
virtual service associated with the same real servers, covering
multiple IP addresses, port and protocol triplets.
.sp
Using firewall-mark virtual services provides a convenient method of
grouping together different IP addresses, ports and protocols into a
single virtual service. This is useful for both simplifying
configuration if a large number of virtual services are required and
grouping persistence across what would otherwise be multiple virtual
services.
.TP
.B -s, --scheduler \fIscheduling-method\fP
\fIscheduling-method\fP  Algorithm for allocating TCP connections and
UDP datagrams to real servers.  Scheduling algorithms are implemented
as kernel modules. Six are shipped with the Linux Virtual Server:
.sp
\fBrr\fR - Robin Robin: distribute jobs equally amongst the
available real servers.
.sp
\fBwrr\fR - Weighted Round Robin: assign jobs to real servers
proportionally to there real servers' weight. Servers with higher
weights receive new jobs first and get more jobs than servers with
lower weights. Servers with equal weights get an equal distribution
of new jobs.
.sp
\fBlc\fR - Least-Connection: assign more jobs to real servers with
fewer active jobs.
.sp
\fBwlc\fR - Weighted Least-Connection: assign more jobs to servers
with fewer jobs and relative to the real servers' weight. This is the
default.
.sp
\fBlblc\fR - Locality-Based Least-Connection: assign jobs destined for
the same IP address to the same server if the server is not overloaded
and available; otherwise assign jobs to servers with fewer jobs, and
keep it for future assignment.
.sp
\fBlblcr\fR - Locality-Based Least-Connection with Replication: assign
jobs destined for the same IP address to the least-connection node in
the server set for the IP address. If all the node in the server set
are over loaded, it picks up a node with fewer jobs in the cluster and
adds it in the sever set for the target. If the server set has not
been modified for the specified time, the most loaded node is removed
from the server set, in order to avoid high degree of replication.
.TP
.B -p, --persistent [\fItimeout\fP]
Specify that a virtual service is persistent. If this option is
specified, multiple requests from a client are redirected to the same
real server selected for the first request.  Optionally, the
\fItimeout\fP of persistent sessions may be specified given in
seconds, otherwise the default of 300 seconds will be used. This
option may be used in conjunction with protocols such as FTP
where it is important that clients consistently connect with the same
real server.
.sp
\fBNote:\fR If a virtual service is to handle FTP connections then
persistence must be set for the virtual service if Direct Routing or
NAT is used as the forwarding mechanism. If masquerading is used in
conjunction with an FTP service than persistence is not necessary, but
the ip_masq_ftp kernel module must be used.  This module may be
manually inserted into the kernel using insmod(8).
.TP
.B -M, --netmask \fInetmask\fP
Specify the granularity with which clients are grouped for persistent
virtual services.  The source address of the request is masked with
this netmask to direct all clients from a network to the same real
server. The default is \fI255.255.255.255\fP, that is, the persistence
granularity is per client host. Less specific netmasks may be used to
resolve problems with non-persistent cache clusters on the client side.
.TP
.B -r, -R, --real-server \fIserver-address\fP
Real server that a request for service may be assigned.  The
\fIserver-address\fP is of the form \fIhost[:port]\fP.  \fIHost\fP is
the address of a real server and may be ither an IP address or a
hostname.  \fIPort\fP can be either a port number or the service name
of port.  In the case of the masquerading method, the host address is
usually an RFC 1918 private IP address, and the port can be different
from that of the associated service.  With the tunnelling and direct
routing methods, \fIport\fP must be equal to that of the service
address. For normal services, the port specified  in the service
address will be used if \fIport\fP is not specified. For fwmark
services, \fIport\fP may be , in  which case  the destination port on
the real server will be the destination port of the request sent to
the virtual  service.
.TP
.B [packet-forwarding-method]
.sp
\fB-g, --gatewaying\fR  Use gatewaying (direct routing). This is the default.
.sp
\fB-i, --ipip\fR  Use ipip encapsulation (tunnelling).
.sp
\fB-m, --masquerading\fR  Use masquerading (network access translation, or NAT).
.sp
\fBNote:\fR  Regardless of the packet-forwarding mechanism specified,
real servers for addresses for which there are interfaces on the local
node will be use the local forwarding method. This cannot be specified
by \fIipvsadm\fP, rather  it set by the kernel as real servers are
added or modified.
.TP
.B -w, --weight \fIweight\fP
\fIWeight\fP is an integer specifying the capacity  of a server
relative to the others in the pool. The valid values of \fIweight\fP
are 0 through to 65535. The default is 1. Quiescent servers are
specified with a weight of zero. A quiescent server will receive no
new jobs but still serve the existing jobs, for all scheduling
algorithms distributed with the Linux Virtual Server. Setting a
quiescent server may be useful if the server is overloaded or needs
to be taken out of service for maintenance.
.TP
.B -n, --numeric
Numeric output.  IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in
numeric format rather than as as host names and services respectively,
which is the  default.
.SH EXAMPLE 1 - Simple Virtual Service
The following commands configure a Linux Director to distribute incoming
requests addressed to port 80 on 207.175.44.110 equally to port 80 on
five real servers. The forwarding method used in this example
is NAT, with each of the real servers being masqueraded by the Linux
Director.
.PP
.nf
ipvsadm -A -t 207.175.44.110:80 -s rr
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.1:80 -m
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.2:80 -m
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.3:80 -m 
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.4:80 -m 
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.5:80 -m 
.fi
.PP
Alternatively, this could be achieved in a single ipvsadm command.
.PP
.nf
echo "
-A -t 207.175.44.110:80 -s rr
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.1:80 -m
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.2:80 -m
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.3:80 -m
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.4:80 -m
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.5:80 -m
" | ipvsadm -R
.fi
r
.PP
As masquerading is used as the forwarding mechanism in this example, the
default route of the real servers must be set to the linux director, which
will need to be configured to forward and masquerade packets. This can be
achieved using the following commands:
.PP
.nf
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
ipchains -A forward -j MASQ -s 192.168.10.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE 2 - Firewall-Mark Virtual Service
The following commands configure a Linux Director to distribute incoming
requests addressed to any port on 207.175.44.110 or 207.175.44.111 equally
to the corresponding port on five real servers. As per the previous
example, the forwarding method used in this example is NAT, with each of
the real servers being masqueraded by the Linux Director.
.PP
.nf
ipvsadm -A -f 1  -s rr
ipvsadm -a -t 1 -r 192.168.10.1:0 -m
ipvsadm -a -t 1 -r 192.168.10.2:0 -m
ipvsadm -a -t 1 -r 192.168.10.3:0 -m 
ipvsadm -a -t 1 -r 192.168.10.4:0 -m 
ipvsadm -a -t 1 -r 192.168.10.5:0 -m 
.fi
.PP
As masquerading is used as the forwarding mechanism in this example,
the default route of the real servers must be set to the linux
director, which will need to be configured to forward and masquerade
packets. The real server should also be configured to mark incoming
packets addressed to any port on 207.175.44.110 and  207.175.44.111
with firewall-mark 1. If FTP traffic is to be handled by this virtual
service, then the ip_masq_ftp kernel module needs to be inserted into
the kernel.  These operations  can be achieved using the following
commands:
.PP
.nf
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
ipchains -A forward -j MASQ -s 192.168.10.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0
ipchains -A input -j ACCEPT -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 207.175.44.110/31 -m 1
modprobe ip_masq_ftp
.fi
.SH NOTES
The Linux Virtual Server implements three defense strategies against
some types of denial of service (DoS) attacks. The Linux Director
creates an entry for each connection in order to keep its state, and
each entry occupies 128 bytes effective memory. LVS's vulnerability to
a DoS attack lies in the potential to increase the number entries as
much as possible until the linux director runs out of memory. The
three defense strategies against the attack are: Randomly drop some
entries in the table. Drop 1/rate packets before forwarding them. And
use secure tcp state transition table and short timeouts. The
strategies are controlled by sysctl variables and corresponding
entries in the /proc filesystem:
.sp
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_entry
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_packet
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/secure_tcp
.PP
Valid values for each variable are 0 through to 3. The default value
is 0, which disables the respective defense strategy. 1 and 2 are
automatic modes - when there is no enough available memory, the
respective strategy will be enabled and the variable is automatically
set to 2, otherwise the strategy is disabled and the variable is set
to 1. A value of 3 denotes that the respective strategy is always
enabled.  The available memory threshold and secure TCP timeouts can
be tuned using the sysctl variables and corresponding entries in the
/proc filesystem:
.sp
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/amemthresh
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_*
